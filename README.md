# OpenCitations-Bot
A bot to add citation data from OpenCitations to Wikidata

This is a bot created by Houcemeddine Turki, member of Data Engineering and Semantics Research Team in University of Sfax, Tunisia. This bot allows the enrichment of Wikidata items about scholarly publications with citation data from OpenCitations, an open bibliographic citation database in RDF format.

Such a process does not cause any legal concern as Wikidata and OpenCitations scholarly knowledge graphs are both issued under CC0 License.
